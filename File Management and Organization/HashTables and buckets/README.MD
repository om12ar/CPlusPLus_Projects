This program contains 3 classes each implements a different type of hashing collision resolution  

1. progressive overflow technique with a hashed index with address size N=100, and bucket size B=3.  

2. double hashing technique with address size N=100, and bucket size B=2.

3. chained with separate overflow technique. with primary address size N=100, bucket size B=1, in the overflow area address size = 50, bucket size = 1.
